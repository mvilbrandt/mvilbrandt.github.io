## A Little About Myself
My name is Mason Vilbrandt, and I am a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and a certificate in Digital Media Analytics. Currently based in Milton, Wisconsin, I am actively pursuing opportunities to apply my analytical skills and data-driven mindset in a professional environment.

I am detail-oriented, passionate about turning data into actionable insights, and eager to contribute to a company that values innovation, precision, and curiosity. Below, you’ll find links to my résumé, project portfolio, and other credentials that highlight my experience and capabilities.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me—I look forward to connecting.
