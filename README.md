## A Little About Myself
My name is Mason Vilbrandt, and I am a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and a certificate in Digital Media Analytics. Currently based in Milton, Wisconsin, I am actively pursuing opportunities to apply my analytical skills and data-driven mindset in a professional environment.

I am detail-oriented, passionate about turning data into actionable insights, and eager to contribute to a company that values innovation, precision, and curiosity. Below, you’ll find links to my résumé, project portfolio, and other credentials that highlight my experience and capabilities.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me—I look forward to connecting.

## Projects

During my final semesters at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, I had the opportunity to work on several collaborative and individual projects that highlight my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Below are links to select projects, including machine learning models and a data visualization project that showcase both my technical abilities and my commitment to clear, impactful storytelling through data.

### ML Project 1: SailCo

This machine learning project was inspired by a model introduced in my Data Optimization course. It focuses on optimizing production planning by determining the number of sailboats that can be manufactured over the next four quarters, given specific demand forecasts and operational constraints. Click below to view the full model and analysis.

### ML Project 2: Widgets

This optimization model is a Critical Path Method (CPM) model implemented in GAMS using GAMSPy. It is used to determine the minimum project completion time for producing a new product at Widgetco.

#### Key features:
Activities: There are 6 project activities (e.g., training workers, purchasing raw materials, making subassemblies).

Precedence constraints: Some activities must be completed before others can begin (e.g., subassemblies can't be made before training and purchasing materials).

Durations: Each activity has a fixed time duration.

Decision variables: The model finds the optimal start time for each activity (t) and the total project duration (projDur).

#### Objective:
Minimize projDur, the total time to complete all activities, while respecting precedence constraints and activity durations.

#### Summary:
This model schedules project tasks to minimize completion time, identifying the critical path — the longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines the project's minimum duration. Below is the html link to the model.
